# .R Packages required


Make sure you have latest R and Rstudio installed before starting this process. These are the R packages that are required to complete the data cleaning and documentation using Rstudio.

* knitr - for rendering HTML reports
* tidyverse - for data manupulations


**Note:** The above packages do not come with Rstudio installation, they need to be installed explictly, use the packages tab or just type install.packages("package_name").


Next load the R packages:
```{r message=FALSE}
#install those packages before run the rmd if there is no package following codes:
#install.packages(c("rio","data.table","dplyr","anytime","knitr","kableExtra", "ggplot2","ISOweek","alluvial","lubridate"))
library("knitr")
library("tidyverse")

```


# .Avian Monitoring - eBird


## Data Preparation

>Reshaped data of Avia Monitoring

 We reshape some data format and create some new columns which are easy and convient for the following analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Avian Monitoring - eBird data
library(rio)
avia <- import("C:\\Users\\indra\\Desktop\\Week12\\OldWomanCreek\\Deliverables\\RScript\\Avia.csv") 

library(data.table)
avia <- setDT(avia)[,Date := as.Date(Date, "%m/%d/%Y")]

namevariable <- names(avia)
namevariable <- gsub(" ","_",namevariable)
namevariable <- gsub("/","_",namevariable)
names(avia) <- namevariable

avia2 <- melt(avia[,c(1:3,6:7)], id.vars = c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird","H_S"))
avia2 <- setDT(avia2)[!is.na(value),]

avia3 <- melt(avia[,c(1:3,8:9)], id.vars = c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird","H_S"))
avia3 <- setDT(avia3)[!is.na(value),]

avia4 <- melt(avia[,c(1:3,10:11)], id.vars = c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird","H_S"))
avia4 <- setDT(avia4)[!is.na(value),]

avia5 <- melt(avia[,c(1:3,12:13)], id.vars = c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird","H_S"))
avia5 <- setDT(avia5)[!is.na(value),]

avia6 <- melt(avia[,c(1:3,14:15)], id.vars = c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird","H_S"))
avia6 <- setDT(avia6)[!is.na(value),]

avia1 <- rbind(avia2,avia3,avia4,avia5,avia6)
rm(avia2,avia3,avia4,avia5,avia6)

avia1 <- setDT(avia1)[,.(value = sum(value)), by = 
                          c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird","H_S","variable")]

avia2 <- setDT(avia)[,.(eachCount = sum(`#_of_Species`), totalCount = sum(Total_species)),by = 
                         c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird")]
library(dplyr)
aviaFinal <- left_join(avia2,avia1,by = c("Monitoring_Route","Date","eBird"))
rm(avia1,avia2)

library(ISOweek)

aviaFinal <- setDT(aviaFinal)[,Weeks := strftime(Date, format = "%Y-W%V")][,c("year", "WeekNoYear") := tstrsplit(Weeks, "-", fixed=TRUE)]
aviaFinal <- aviaFinal[,firstWeekDay := paste(Weeks,1,sep = "-")][,firstWeekDay := 
                                               ISOweek2date(firstWeekDay)][,firstWeekDay := 
                                                                        strftime(firstWeekDay, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]

library(lubridate)
aviaFinal <- setDT(aviaFinal)[,`:=`(Year= year(Date),Month = month(Date),MonthWithYear = strftime(Date, format = "%Y-%m"))]

aviaFinal <- aviaFinal[,season := ifelse(Month %in% c(3,4,5),"spring",ifelse(Month %in% c(6,7,8),"summer",ifelse(Month %in% c(9,10,11),"autumn","winter")))]

aviaFinal <- aviaFinal[, H_S :=  recode(H_S,"1"= "Heard","2"="Seen","3"="H&S")]

aviaNoYear <- aviaFinal[,.(value = sum(value,na.rm = T)), by= c("WeekNoYear","variable")][!is.na(variable),]

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

aviaFinal <- aviaFinal[,-c("year","firstWeekDay")]
kable(sample_n(aviaFinal, 5)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)

```



> Data from eBird

  With the limited access to eBird dataset, we cannot compare this example data with our data directly, we just take this part of example data from eBird website as reference, whcih will make the following analysis easier.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#ebird data

ebird <- import("C:\\Users\\indra\\Desktop\\Week12\\OldWomanCreek\\Deliverables\\RScript\\ebirdWebData.xlsx") 

namevariable <- names(ebird)
namevariable <- gsub("# ","",namevariable)
namevariable <- gsub(" ","_",namevariable)
names(ebird) <- namevariable

ebird <- setDT(ebird)[,Week_starting_on := strftime(Week_starting_on, 
                                                    format = "%m-%d")][,variable := species][,variable := recode(variable,"Wood Duck" = "WODU","Marsh Wren" = "MAWR", "Great Blue Heron" = "GBHE", "Wood Thrush" = "WOTH", "Canada Goose" = "CAGO")]

kable(sample_n(ebird, 5)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)

```

## Descriptive Analysis

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

aviaAllu <- aviaFinal[!is.na(aviaFinal$variable),c(1,6,11,14,7:8)]
aviaAllu <- setDT(aviaAllu)[,.(value = sum(value)),by = c("Monitoring_Route","H_S","variable","Year","season")]
aviaAllu <- aviaAllu[,c("variable","Year","H_S","Monitoring_Route","season","value")]

basicInfo <- aviaAllu[,.(min = min(value),median = median(value),mean = mean(value), max = max(value)), 
                      by = variable]
kable(basicInfo) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)



```




### Cross Table

>  With season

   First, we compare these five speices seasonally which includes autumn, spring, summer and winter.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
aviaAllus <- data.table::dcast(aviaAllu,variable ~ season,fun = sum, value.var=c("value"))

kable(head(aviaAllus)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

> With Monitoring Route

  Secondly, we compare thesee five species based on Monitoring_Route which includes Blue Trail, Green Trail, Purpule Trail and Red Trail.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
aviaAllus <- data.table::dcast(aviaAllu,variable ~ Monitoring_Route,fun = sum, value.var=c("value"))

kable(head(aviaAllus)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

> With H_S

  Thirdly, we comare these five species based on H_S which means the species both heard and seen, headred, seen seperately. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
aviaAllus <- data.table::dcast(aviaAllu,variable ~ H_S,fun = sum, value.var=c("value"))

kable(head(aviaAllus)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

> With Year

  Forthly, we coompare these five species yearly which mainly focues on 2016, 2017, 2018 years.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
aviaAllus <- data.table::dcast(aviaAllu,variable ~ Year,fun = sum, value.var=c("value"))

kable(head(aviaAllus)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```


## ANOVA Analysis

According to descriptive part, We can be sure each variable with each species in the sample is not homogeneous. But five species have their unique characters on each variable, and we may eplore more relationship on the variables.

The total number of observation in MAWR, WOTH and WODU is not much enough to well estimate the variables difference in the sample. We will only take a trying to test anova group defference on the two species(CAGO, GBHE).

### Canada Goose(CAGO)


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Randomized Block Design
fit <- aov(value ~ H_S + Year + Monitoring_Route + season, aviaAllu[variable == "CAGO",])
anova(fit)

```

As the result shows, we can not reject the null hypothesis on 5%, GAGO's observation number in the four variables has no significant different.


### Great blue hero(GBHE)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Randomized Block Design
fit <- aov(value ~ H_S +  season + Year + Monitoring_Route, aviaAllu[variable == "GBHE",])
anova(fit)
```

Still no variable's p-value low than 5% in GBHE. But as the result of the fit and the alluvial diagram suggest, the independence variables have interaction.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Two Way Factorial Design 
fit <- aov(value ~  season * H_S, aviaAllu[variable == "GBHE",])
anova(fit)
```

With the involving of the interaction, the H_S variable seems to be significant this time. It means different season has different observation ways number.


# .Avian Monitoring - Indicator Species

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
avian <- read.csv("C:/Users/indra/Desktop/Week12/OldWomanCreek/Deliverables/RScript/AvianData.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

##attach(avian)

avian$Date<-as.Date(avian$Date)

## the code below removes all the empty lines 
library(tidyverse)
avian <- filter(avian, !(is.na(EABL) & is.na(WBNU) & is.na(COYE)	 & is.na(EAKI) & is.na(MALL) & is.na(CAGO) & is.na(MODO) & is.na(MAWR) & is.na(CATE) & is.na(GREG) & is.na(WODU) & is.na(GBHE) & is.na(RBWO) & is.na(WOTH) & is.na(GRFL) & is.na(AMRE) & is.na(EATO)))

str(avian)

summary(avian)


```
```{r}
boxplot(avian$EABL, main = 'Eastern Blue Bird', ylab='No. observed')
```
```{r}
CAGO.ts<- ts(avian$CAGO,start = c(2016), frequency = 365)
  plot(CAGO.ts, main = 'Canada Goose')
```



# Bald Eagle Nesting

Based on Research questions, we have identified the following variables that are useful in deriving our data insights and conclusions. There are two types of data that are observed by the scientists/volunteers in same dataset i.e,  Quantitative data and Qualitative data.

## Qualitative Data Variables:

The following data values are descriptive and non-numeric.

* NestStatus
* NestCondition
* BirdsPresent&Plumages
* BirdsonNest
* AprroxEggs
* ApproxChicks

Setting the working directory and reading the cleaned data:
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/indra/Desktop/Week12/OldWomanCreek/Deliverables/RScript") # setting the working dir
eagle_raw_data <- read.csv("BaldEagle.csv") # reading the csv data
```

'eagle_raw_data' stores the whole dataset from csv file. We make data manupulations of the variable 'eagle_raw_data'. 


### Frequency Distribution of Qualitative Data:
```{r}
NestStatus = eagle_raw_data$NestStatus # select NestStatus from raw data
NestStatus.freq = table(NestStatus) # Apply the table function
```

NestStatus.freq stores the frequency of each occurence. Lets view the frequecy distribution:
```{r}
kable(NestStatus.freq) # view the distributions
```

Similarly, we can get the frequency distribution for other qualitative variables. We are working on using this frequency to get the plots by joining the Quantitative data.


### Relative Frequency Distribution of Qualitative Data


> The relative frequency distribution of a data variable is a summary of the frequency proportion in a collection of non-overlapping categories. [2]


The relationship of frequency and relative frequency is:


<img src="http://bit.ly/2zdC2ZP" align="center" border="0" alt="Relative Frequency =  \frac{Frequency}{Sample Size} " width="294" height="46" />

```{r}
NestStatus.relfreq = NestStatus.freq / nrow(eagle_raw_data) # calculating the relative freq.
```

Rounding the decimal frequencies to '3' digits. 


```{r}
old = options(digits = 3)
kable(NestStatus.relfreq)
options(old)
```


### Barplot for Frequency

```{r}
barplot(NestStatus.freq)
```


### Pie Chart for Frequency


```{r}
colors = c("red", "yellow", "green", "violet", "orange", "blue", "pink", "cyan")
pie(NestStatus.freq, col=colors)
```


### Category Statistics


H - stands for hatching Nest Status. To find mean temperature(F) for 'Nest Status' = H.

Create logical vector for NestStatus = H:
```{r}
H_NestStatus = NestStatus =='H'
```


```{r}
H_eagle_raw_data = eagle_raw_data[H_NestStatus,]
```

Now, find the mean Temperature(F) of NestStatus = H:
```{r}
round(mean(H_eagle_raw_data$Temp), digits = 2)
```

The average mean temperature for NestStatus = Hatching is 59.84


Similarly, summary will show the quantile, median, Min, Max and Mean values for temperature when NestStatus = H:
```{r warning=FALSE}
summary(H_eagle_raw_data$Temp)
```


## Quantitative Data Variables: 

The following data values are non-descriptive and numeric.

* Temp
* Wind-Velocity
* Wind-Direction
* Precipatation
* CloudCover


```{r}


```
